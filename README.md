macbook touchbar composed of a lot of my own and other people's code

![Here's what it looks like](https://github.com/caIamity/calatouchbar/blob/master/Touch%20Bar%20Shot%202020-07-09%20at%2016.24.24.png)

From left to right:
 -CPU load and fan speed
 -Spotify shows the current song, can be replaced by itunes
 -Weather works, you can change it to a preferred service/API
 -media tools, work for both spotify and itunes, mute works for everything
 -battery %, shows a lightning bolt if charging
 -time, changes depending on selected system time
 -sleep button
 -convenient exit button to return you to your default touchbar
